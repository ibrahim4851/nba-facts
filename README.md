### NOTE: My Project's still under development.

## ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢Announcement
### There are many code snippets in my project that's so similar. I'm looking for your help to minimize these functions.

## Used Technologies:
* MVVM Architecture
* RxJava
* Retrofit
* DataBinding
* Glide
* Navigation
* Pagination

## I will add these following features:
  * Clicking on RecyclerView items will send to another fragment that shows details about it (Each Fragment)
  * Search for a team
  * Seasons
  * ..and so forth

## Motivation
I always think that there's always better. This also applies to application developing. Therefore, I wanted to upgrade my quality of code,
so I started this project which includes MVVM, DataBinding, Navigation and RxJava.

## About API
I was searching for a free API, then I've found this amazing one that named BallDontLie.
It retrieves data about NBA. It includes all players, almost all games, and all teams' informations.
BallDontLie repo link is [here](https://github.com/ynnadkrap/balldontlie)
You can find out about API details and usage on this [link](http://www.balldontlie.io)
